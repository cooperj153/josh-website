   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>PKR is an epic parkour event that occurs every year in Auckland, during August. It is open to anyone who likes parkour or just enjoys watching it. PKR offers a unique experience to learn new skills, tricks and techniques from experienced competitors and teachers so you can show off to your friends or even come back as a competitor.</p>

<p>The PKR event is a platform for serious competitors to show off their skills and easily gain exposure through social media, so you can rise up the ranks and become well known in the parkour community.</p>

<p>The competition will be judged by two parkour pros, Pasha Petkuns and Jiemba Sands, who will also be testing their skills on the obstacle course. </p>
